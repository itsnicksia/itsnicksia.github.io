Hello, my name is Nick!

I've been doing software engineering for over a decade now, spanning Mining & Exploration, Government, Medical, Gaming, Social Media, and Telecommunications.

I've built and operated systems of varying scales, from serving 0 requests per second, to thousands of requests a second momentarily, then 0 requests per second shortly after.

In the future, I would like to build a guestbook where you can sign your name with a comment, and a button that increments a textbox when you click it.
